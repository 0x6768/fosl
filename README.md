## 📋 Flexible Open Source License (FOSL)

A modern, modular-friendly open source license designed for developers who want freedom with responsibility.
---

## Why FOSL?

- ✅ Free to use, modify, and distribute
- ✅ Modular/library-friendly (see Article 9)
- ✅ Clear warranty disclaimer (Article 5)
- ✅ Developer免责 clause (Article 7.5)
- ✅ Contributor License Grant (Article 8)
- ✅ Contractual nature — you agree by using the software
- ✅ Suitable for Chinese community projects (applies China law by default)

## 🧠 Summary: Why This Table Matters

This checklist helps enterprises and developers quickly understand:

- Which licenses are safe to use in commercial products
- Which ones require you to open-source your own code
- Which protect developer rights
- Which support library/module usage
- Which have legal enforceability and dispute resolution clauses

## 🎯 FOSL Highlights (Why It Stands Out)

| Strength | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ Modular-Friendly | Article 9 allows using unmodified software without forcing the entire project to adopt the same license |
| ✅ Developer Protection | Article 7.5 clearly states that developers aren’t obligated to fulfill every request |
| ✅ Legal Binding Nature | Preamble and Article 7 make it clear that users agree to be bound by the terms |
| ✅ Trademark & IP Control | Article 4.2 retains patent and trademark rights |
| ✅ Suitable for Chinese Projects | Supports localization, Chinese law, and community-driven updates |
| ✅ Clear Termination & Redistribution Rules | Articles 6 and 9 define what happens when you modify or distribute the software |

## 📌 Final One-Liner:

> **FOSL strikes a balance between freedom and control — it's permissive like MIT, has module-friendliness like LGPL, and adds unique features like developer waiver clauses and community-driven governance.**
